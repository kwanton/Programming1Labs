output "ad cost," "sales," and "profit," into columns
REPEAT while previous profit is less than profit
	set previous profit equal to profit
	reset sales to 200 for calculation
	
	sales = ((row - 1) * 0.2) * sales + sales
	revenue = sales * 300
	profit = revenue - (1000 + ad cost)
	
	output ad cost, sales, and profit variables on a new line to their respective columns

	ad cost = ad cost * 2
	row = row + 1
ENDREPEAT
