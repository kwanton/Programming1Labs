This program will determine if a triange can exist with the given side lengths
Inputs: Side 1, Side 2, Side 3
Outputs: None
Formulas: Side 1 + Side 2, Side 2 + Side 3, Side 1 + Side 3

start
ask for side 1
ask for side 2
ask for side 3
IF side 1 is greater than 0, and, if side 2 is greater than 0, and, side 3 is greater than 0 
	IF side 1 + side 2 is less than side 3, or, side 2 + side 3 is less than side 1, 
   	or, side 1 + side 3 is less than side 2
		output error message
	ELSE
		output "this triange can exist within our laws of reality!"
	ENDIF
ELSE
	output error message
